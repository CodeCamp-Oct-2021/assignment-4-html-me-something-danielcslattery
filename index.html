            </header>
            <p>CSS works closely with HTML to add style to the page. 
               Things like altering text and background color, chaning font, and positioning text are done in CSS. 
               Generally, CSS rules are located in a .css file linked to the html file.</p>

               <h2>Consider Learning JavaScript</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Take your website out of the early oughts with JavaScript. 
               JavaScript adds dynamics to a website, like clicking a button that can change something on the page.
               It will also let you create submission forms. </p>

            <p id="testP" class = "funParagraph">The three topics mentioned above can create very simple pages, but you'll need to learn more to be able to jump between pages.
               Most companies separate the visual part of the website and the background mechanics into separate roles.  
               It can be helpful to know at least some of both.
